Kern AI refinery (abbr. _refinery_) is like the data-centric sibling of your favorite programming environment. It provides an easy-to-use interface for weak supervision as well as extensive data management, neural search and monitoring to ensure that the quality of your training data is as good as possible.

_refinery_ doesn't get rid of manual labeling, but it makes sure that your valuable time is spent well.

![Showcase GIF of _refinery_](refinery.gif)

_refinery_ consists of multiple microservices to enable a scalable and optimized workload balance, so this is the central repository used to orchestrate the system. It builds on top of [ü§ó Hugging Face](https://www.huggingface.co) and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) to leverage pre-built language models for your NLP tasks, as well as [qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant) for neural search. Our microservices natively support GPU acceleration.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Why _refinery_? Built for developers with collaboration in mind
There are already many other labeling tools out there, so why did we decide to build *yet another one*? 

### Open-source and developer-oriented
We believe that there is a lack of *open-source, developer-oriented* tools for data-centric NLP. In other terms: developers and scientists should be able to participate in the refinement of raw data to training data, but with the programmatic approach they love. That's why we made sure that integrations to tools like [ü§ó Hugging Face](https://www.huggingface.co) and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) are as easy as possible.


### For automation or quality control
The labeling workflow in _refinery_ is designed to integrate heuristics like labeling functions or active learning modules, which are combined via weak supervision. This way, you can either prototype the training data for your model from scratch, or improve existing training data continuously. We designed our workflow and data management such that you can do exactly that, and find the spots in your data that need to be re-visited.

### Improving collaboration with subject matter experts
While doing so, we aim to improve the collaboration between engineers and subject matter experts (SMEs). In the past, we've seen how our application was being used in meetings to discuss label patterns in form of labeling functions and distant supervisors. We believe that data-centric AI is the best way to leverage collaboration.

### Integrations
Lastly, _refinery_ supports [SDK actions](https://github.com/code-kern-ai/refinery-python) like pulling and pushing data. Data-centric AI redefines labeling to be more than a one-time job by giving it an iterative workflow, so we aim to give you more power every day by providing end-to-end capabilities, growing the large-scale availability of high-quality training data. Use our SDK to program integrations with your existing landscapes. By the way, tell us which integrations you'd like to have [here](https://discuss.kern.ai/c/enhancements/6).


### Your benefits
You gain better insights into the data labeling workflow, receive an implicit documentation for your training data (which you can use to discuss findings), and can ultimately build better models in shorter time.

Our goal is to make labeling feel more like a programmatic and enjoyable task, instead of something tedious and repetitive. _refinery_ is our contribution to this goal. And we're constantly aiming to improve this contribution.

## üê≥ Installation via Docker

**TL;DR:**
```
$ git clone https://github.com/code-kern-ai/refinery.git
$ cd refinery
$ docker-compose up -d
# Now visit http://localhost:4455
```

_refinery_ consists of multiple services that need to be run together. To do so, we've set up a `docker-compose` file, which will automatically pull and connect the respective services for you. The file is part of this repository, so you can just clone it and run `docker-compose up -d` in the repository. After some minutes (now is a good time to grab a coffee ‚òï), the setup is done and you can access `http://localhost:4455` in your browser.

**You're ready to start! üôå üéâ**

If you run into any issues during installation, please don't hesitate to reach out to us (see community section below).

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Concept questions
<details>
    <summary><b>What is a heuristic?</b></summary>
    Heuristics are the ingredients for scaling your data labeling. They don't have to be 100% accurate, heuristics can be e.g. simple Python functions expressing some domain knowledge. When you add and run several of these heuristics, you create what is called a noisy label matrix, that is matched against the reference data that you manually labeled. This allows us to analyze correlations, conflicts, overlaps, the number of hits for a data set, and the accuracy of each heuristic.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>How can I build an active learning model?</b></summary>
    We use pre-trained models to create embeddings in the first place. Once this is done, the embeddings are available in the application (both for building active learning heuristics and neural search). In our active learning IDE, you can then build a simple classification or extraction head on top of the embedding, and we'll manage then execution in a containerized environment.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>How do I know whether my heuristic is good?</b></summary>
    A heuristic can be ‚Äúgood‚Äù with respect to both coverage and precision. For coverage there basically is no limitation at all, for precision we generally recommend some value above 70%, depending on how many heuristics you have. The more heuristics you have, the more overlaps and conflicts will be given, the better weak supervision can work.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>If I can automate the labeling, why should I train a model at all?</b></summary>
    Technically, you could use our _refinery_ for inference. However, best results are achieved if a supervised learning model is trained on the generated labels, as these models improve generalization. It‚Äôs just a best practice. If you want to use the model for inference, check out our open-source library <a href="https://github.com/code-kern-ai/weak-nlp">weak-nlp</a>.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>I have less than 1,000 records - Do I need this?</b></summary>
    You can definitely use _refinery_ for smaller datasets, too! It now only shines via programmatic labeling, but also has a simple and beautiful UI. Go for it üòÅ
</details>

### Technical questions
<details>
    <summary><b>How can I upload data?</b></summary>
    We use <a href="https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas">pandas</a> internally for matching your data to our JSON-based data model. You can upload the data via our UI, or via our <a href="https://github.com/code-kern-ai/refinery-python">Python SDK</a>.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>How can I download data, and what format does it have?</b></summary>
    You can download your data in our UI or via the <a href="https://github.com/code-kern-ai/refinery-python">Python SDK</a>, where we also provide e.g. adapters to <a href="https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa">Rasa</a>. The export looks something like this:

It also comes with adapters, e.g. to [Rasa](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa).

## üè´ Glossary
| Term  	| Meaning  	|
|---	|---	|
| Weak supervision  	| Technique/methodology to integrate different kinds of noisy and imperfect heuristics like labeling functions. It can be used not only to automate data labeling, but generally as an approach to improve your existing label quality. 	|
| Neural search  	| Embedding-based approach to retrieve information; instead of telling a machine a set of constraints, neural search analyzes the vector space of data (encoded via e.g. pre-trained neural networks). Can be used e.g. to find nearest neighbors.  	|
| Active learning  	| As data is labeled manually, a model is trained continuously to support the annotator. Can be used e.g. stand-alone, or as a heuristic for weak supervision.  	|
| Vector encoding (embedding)  	| Using pre-trained models such as transformers from [ü§ó Hugging Face](https://www.huggingface.co), texts can be transformed into vector space. This is both helpful for neural search and active learning (in the latter case, simple classifiers can be applied on top of the embedding, which enables fast re-training on the vector representations). 	|
